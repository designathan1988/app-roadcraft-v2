/**
 * THE GRID ON THE PLANET (`world/grid.ts` snapToGrid, `world/planet/charts.ts`
 * snapToFaceGridInto; drawn by `render/terrain.ts` uGrid). Run with
 * `vitest.planet.config.ts`.
 *
 * Drawn and snapped on every piece's own map, the grid broke at each piece's
 * border: two charts put their lines a few metres apart and turned, and a
 * road snapped on one did not meet the grid of the next. Then the cube
 * faces' own: continuous, but bent at every cube edge and met three ways at
 * the corners (the player, 2026-10-10). It is now one map about one point of
 * the planet (`GRID_ORIGIN`): smooth everywhere but at the far side.
