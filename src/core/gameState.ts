/**
 * THE GAME'S STATE: what the player has in hand and how the game runs - the
 * tool, the pause and speed, the quality, the selection - owned in one place,
 * and every change of it written down: what changed, from what to what, and
 * why (the player, 2026-10-08: "o jogo precisa ter um controlador global de
 * estados, eventos"). Before it these were loose variables of `main.ts`,
 * written from some thirty places with no record.
 *
 * The world's own changes are in the document's diary (`world/changes.ts`).
 * This one is apart on purpose: an entry here has no place on the map, and a
 * reader of the diary takes an entry with no place as the whole map changed;
 * and the interface changes far more often than the world, which would push
 * the world's entries out of the diary's ring.
 *
 * An entry is an event - what already happened, its values captured when it
 * is written - in a ring of fixed size (Nystrom, "Event Queue"). `set` is
 * the one way in, and a value set to what it already is writes nothing;
 * `values` is a read-only view, so there is no second copy to drift.
 *
 * Whoever reacts to a change `watch`es its keys. Nobody is called inside
 * `set`: the frame calls `flush` once, and each watcher gets the changes of
 * its keys since the serial it last saw (Nystrom, "Event Queue": decouple
 * when an event is sent from when it is processed; "Observer": a watcher
 * that changes state while being told of a change starts a loop, so what it
 * sets is told in the next flush). `watch` returns the way out, so a panel
 * that goes away stops being told (the lapsed listener).
 *
 * Pure: no three, no DOM.
