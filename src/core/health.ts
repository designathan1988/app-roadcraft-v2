/**
 * THE GAME'S HEALTH: what broke and what was slow, written down as it
 * happens, with what the player was doing - so a defect is known when it
 * happens, not when the player reports it (the player, 2026-10-08: "saiba
 * quando algo quebrou, está lento"; "tem coisas que não funciona e você nem
 * sabe").
 *
 * An entry is an event already past, its data captured when it is written
 * (Nystrom, "Event Queue"), in a ring of fixed size. The same failure
 * repeating is one entry with a count (the queue's "aggregating requests"):
 * an error thrown every frame must not push everything else out.
 *
 * Slowness is measured per system (`FrameTimer`): each frame notes how long
 * each system of the frame loop took, against a budget declared once here,
 * so a long frame (over 50 ms: MDN, Long Animation Frames) is told with the
 * systems that took it.
 *
 * Pure: no three, no DOM. The page's own signals (errors, the console,
 * workers, WebGL, long frames) are wired in `ui/healthWatch.ts`.
