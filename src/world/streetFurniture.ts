 * Where every piece of street furniture stands.

 * This used to be written twice: once in `render/scenery.ts`, which drew the
 * lamps, bins and benches, and once, by hand and "at the same positions", in
 * `sim/peds/clearance.ts`, which keeps pedestrians from walking through them.
 * Two copies of a layout drift - adding a street tree to one would have put a
 * tree on the pavement that people walked straight through. It is one list now,
 * derived from the document and the network, and both read it.
 *
 * Positions only. Heights belong to the road field and are the renderer's to
 * look up; the simulation walks in plan.
