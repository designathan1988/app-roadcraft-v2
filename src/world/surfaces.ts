 * Whether this pass draws the junction at a node.
 *
 * A junction's rings are built once, from ALL of the node's legs, whatever
 * structure each belongs to — so they cannot simply be drawn in every pass that
 * has a leg there. Doing that painted the same shape twice at two elevations:
 * on a saved map the ground throat and the raised ring crossed each other and
 * one road's markings cut across the other's deck. Skipping them in every pass
 * is the other half of the same defect: a segment ending on another structure
 * keeps its own closed end, so its kerb and footway bands close ACROSS the
 * carriageway and paint a pale stripe over the join, and the mouth it was cut
 * for is filled by nothing at all.
 *
 * The junction belongs to the pass whose deck is at grade — the lowest structure
 * at that node. A road on the ground keeps its mouth and its markings; a raised
 * deck arriving there comes down to it along its own ramp and draws no junction
 * of its own. (A road network draws a junction where roads CONNECT and a
 * crossing where they pass at different levels — see the OpenDRIVE junction
 * model. Here, every node the editor allows is a connection: the raised deck
 * ramps down to the ground at it.) Tunnels are left out of the choice because
 * they build no surface at all.
