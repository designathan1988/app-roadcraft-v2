/**
 * THE DROPPED KERBS: at each end of every zebra the footway ramps down to the
 * carriageway, so nobody steps off a 15 cm kerb onto a crossing - and nobody
 * drawn on one is lowered 15 cm in a single frame, which is what a walker
 * reaching the zebra did while the footway ran at full height to its edge.
 *
 * A curb ramp (curb cut, dropped kerb) slopes no steeper than 1:12, its flared
 * sides no steeper than 1:10, and is at least 1 m wide (US accessibility
 * guidance, as Wikipedia "Curb cut" gives it; the Brazilian NBR 9050 asks the
 * same 8.33 %). Here each is the zebra's own width, from the kerb face into the
 * footway, the flares either side along the street.
 *
 * One function says how high the walking surface stands at a point
 * (`walkingRise`): the footway's mesh, its kerb and the people standing on it
 * read the same, so the body meets the paving drawn under its feet.
