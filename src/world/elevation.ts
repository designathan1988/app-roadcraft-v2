/**
 * ONE continuous height field for every road surface in the network.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * A road surface is not drawn as a strip per segment: the whole network is
 * clipped into four band polygons (`world/surfaces.ts`) and each band becomes a
 * single mesh. A mesh vertex therefore knows only its own `(x, y)` — it does not
 * know which segment it came from — so the elevation has to be a FUNCTION OF
 * POSITION, and that function must be continuous. Anything else tears the mesh:
 *
 *  - a per-segment profile picked by "nearest segment" steps at every point
 *    where the nearest segment changes, which is exactly the middle of every
 *    junction — the cracks, steps and overlapping plates reported as broken
 *    mesh;
 *  - `max(profile, terrain + clearance)` evaluated per vertex makes the surface
 *    copy the terrain inside junctions while the ribbon stays flat, so a
 *    junction became a dented bowl rather than a plate;
 *  - a raised deck whose height was the nearest span's made two spans of one
 *    chain disagree over the junction between them.
 *
 * The field below is continuous by construction and solves the whole network at
 * once, so every band, every marking and every agent reads the SAME number at
 * the same point. That is what makes the surfaces watertight.
 *
 * ## How it is built
 *
 * 1. Every segment gets a longitudinal profile sampled at fixed stations.
 * 2. The ends of every profile are FLAT over the junction's own reach (the trim
 *    distance the network already computed). That flat piece is the junction
 *    plate: because every leg of a node is flat at the same node height over
 *    that reach, the plate and all its legs agree exactly.
 * 3. Node heights are solved globally, so a node shared by four roads has one
 *    height and a raised span landing on a ground road lands ON it.
 * 4. Profiles are grade-limited (raise-only) so a road never exceeds its class
 *    gradient and never dives under the ground it already cleared.
 *
 * ## How it is queried
 *
 * `at(x, y)` blends the profiles of the segments near the point with weights
 * that fall off smoothly with distance. Far from a junction the nearest segment
 * dominates and the answer is its profile; inside a junction all legs are flat
 * at the node height, so every blend of them is that same height. The blend has
 * no discontinuity anywhere, which is the property the mesh needs.
