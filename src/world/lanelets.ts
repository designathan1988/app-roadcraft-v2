 * assumed: projecting `(0, 100)` lands 105 pixels ABOVE the origin. So the

 * counter-clockwise, and counter-clockwise is a LEFT turn.
 *
 * Every other file already agreed with that. `laneOffset` pushes traffic onto
 * `-perp` and calls it right-hand traffic; `render/signals.ts` puts the head
 * on `-perp` and calls it the right-hand kerb. Only this function read the
 * sign the other way, and because every rule downstream is keyed on the label
 * it produces, all of them applied to the opposite movement:
 *
 *   - `laneIsPlausible` made left turns leave from the kerb lane and right
 *     turns from the innermost lane, so both crossed their own approach's
 *     through lanes;
 *   - the right-on-red exemption in `sim/signals/permission.ts` was granted to

 *     every one of the 11 entries on red was a real LEFT turn, 4 of them while

 *
 * `laneIndex` 0 is the INNERMOST lane; higher indices sit progressively further
 * to the right of travel. So the innermost lane turns left and the outermost
 * lane turns right.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS: connections leaving one approach are ORDER PRESERVING
 * and INJECTIVE — lane `i` goes to lane `i`, and no two of them ever land on
 * the same receiving lane. Two paths that keep their lane order are concentric;
 * they never cross. Two that converge do, and `ConflictIndex` then generates a
 * perfectly correct crossing point between two movements that a real layout
 * draws as parallel.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. The previous rule was
 *
 *   if (turn === 'right') return i === 0 || o === i;   // lane 0 -> ANY lane
 *   return o === i || Math.abs(o - i) === 1;           // through may drift one
 *
 * so `right(lane 0)` reached every receiving lane and `through` could drift
 * sideways. Measured on a 4x4 grid of four-lane avenues, 89.1 % of the conflicts
 * that stopped a vehicle at its own green light named a holder on the SAME
 * approach that was ALSO green — 56.8 % of them a second right turn, and even
 * `through(0)` against `through(1)`, which cannot cross under any geometry.
 *
 * Unequal lane counts are handled by the merge fallback in `build`, not here:
 * an inbound lane that this rule leaves with no exit at all is given one, and
 * that merge is deliberate and singular rather than an accident of pairing.
 *
 * LANE DISCIPLINE (CTB art. 38). A driver about to turn must already be in the
 * lane the turn leaves from, and must land in the corresponding lane of the
 * receiving road — never cross the carriageway to reach the turn. So a right
 * turn leaves the OUTERMOST lane and enters the outermost receiving lane, and a
 * left turn leaves the innermost and enters the innermost.
 *
 * That makes a turn reachable only from one lane, which is exactly why
 * `src/sim/vehicles/laneChange.ts` exists: a vehicle that wants a turn its
 * current lane cannot serve moves across to the lane that can, in advance, with
 * a gap. Before lane changing existed this rule was unshippable, because a left
 * turn lands a vehicle in the innermost lane and a following right turn was
 * then unreachable for the rest of its life.
