/**
 * Every outer surface of a junction, derived from its kerb line.
 *
 * A junction used to be solved four times, once per surface (carriageway,
 * kerb, footway, verge), each with its own trims and its own corner radius,
 * and the four outlines were then unioned. They did not agree: the footway's
 * own return reached its own mouth while the kerb's stopped short of it, a
 * leg was cut at a different distance on each surface, and the square back
 * corner of the footway was a separate kite laid over all of it. What the
 * player saw was a notch in the back of every footway corner, a step where a
 * kerb return met its leg, and lumps of footway standing proud of the corner.
 *
 * Here the junction is solved ONCE, on the carriageway (the kerb face), as a
 * road designer lays it out, and every other surface is an offset of that one
 * outline (procedural junction builders do the same: the curb return is
 * computed once, the curb and the sidewalk are bands along it):
 *
 * - every surface is cut at the SAME distance along each leg, so a mouth is
 *   one straight cut across the whole cross-section;
 * - the kerb stone follows the kerb return concentrically, its own width
 *   further from the carriageway all the way round;
 * - the back of the footway, and the verge beyond it, turn a square corner,
 *   as the building line of a block does, where the two footway edges meet
 *   at a sane angle; elsewhere they follow the kerb return too.
 *
 * When the carriageway itself is not an ordinary junction (a taper, a seam,
 * a shallow merge, a hull fallback) nothing is derived and each surface is
 * built on its own as before.
