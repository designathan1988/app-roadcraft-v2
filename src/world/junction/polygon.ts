 *
 * They do not at a bend. Two legs leaving at 60 and 105 degrees — a hairpin on

 * there in a point at the node itself. Measured on that node, the surface had

 * the footway all stopped dead on a straight cut, the two cuts met at a spike,
 * and the outside of the bend was a vertical face onto the grass with no kerb
 * on it at all.
 *
 * The cap is a disc of the level's own half-width. Its radius therefore nests
 * exactly like every other ring — casing over footway over kerb over
 * carriageway — so the bands wrap the outside of the bend instead of ending,
 * and the outer edge becomes an arc rather than a point. Inside the tongues it
 * is invisible, which is why it can be a full circle rather than a sector: the
