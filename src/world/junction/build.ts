  // crossing of two classes and 20 -> 12 on a five-leg star.
  //
  // Both ways of arranging that growth break something load-bearing:
  //
  //   Let the mouths move out to meet the arcs — every junction lengthens, the
  //   link beside it shortens, and the 4x4 grid of 70-unit blocks ends with two
  //   vehicles holding a junction they can never enter. Scaling by the
  //   per-segment radius factor did not recover it.

  //   stop nesting, which is the guarantee that keeps a kerb inside its footway,
  //   and the ring simplicity fuzz rate rises with it.

  //
  // DEGRADING A HAIRPIN JUNCTION HERE: TWO ATTEMPTS, BOTH MEASURED, BOTH WORSE.
  // Left undone deliberately; the rule that matters now runs upstream instead.
  //
  // The goal was: a node below `MIN_LEG_ANGLE` should not paint a long finger
  // of kerb and footway across open grass. A measurement script (since
  // removed) put a 7-degree hairpin's tongue at 246 units, 16.6 times the road's half-width,
  // against 2.0 for a healthy cross or T.
  //
  //   1. Capping the TRIMS at three half-widths. The hull-fallback rate over
  //      five thousand random junctions went from under 1 % to 53 %, and the
  //      named 15-degree fork broke. Exactly what `corners.ts:112` predicts: a
  //      shorter setback puts one leg's mouth inside the other's carriageway
  //      and the ring stops being simple. Half the map on a convex hull is a
  //      worse map than a pale finger.
  //
  //   2. Shortening or dropping the TONGUES, leaving the ring untouched. The
  //      fuzz sweep catches it by sampling the midpoint between node and mouth:
  //      at a hairpin the corner ring's vertices all sit far from the node, so
  //      the tongue is the only thing covering the approach. Shortening it puts
  //      a HOLE in the drivable surface — a hole where a vehicle drives, which
  //      is worse than a pale patch where nothing does.
  //
  // Both would have needed an existing test weakened to land, and a test that
  // says "no hole in the surface a car drives on" is not one to weaken.
  //
  // What answers it is upstream: a node below `MIN_LEG_ANGLE` is found on
  // every rebuild (`Network.impossible`), and the roundabout and street-object
  // tools refuse to build on one. Drawing and dragging used to refuse such a
  // node too; that refusal went with the freeform roads (e77538b7).

  // A bump moved a mouth after the legs were framed for it. On a curved leg
  // the mouth was then cut square to the tangent at the OLD distance - a wedge
  // of bare ground between the plate and the ribbon, up to 19 degrees out on a

  // actually used; they re-sort by angle, so the trims travel by segment.
