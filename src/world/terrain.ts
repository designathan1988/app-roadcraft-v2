 * wavelength alone the field's median slope came out at 2 degrees and its
 * steepest at 7, which changes how much sun a face takes by about a tenth —
 * under the eye's threshold for reading shape, and the reason the ground still
 * looked painted after the lighting was fixed. Shortening the wavelengths and
 * splitting the amplitude across four octaves brings the median to roughly 7
 * degrees and the steepest to around 20, which the sun models clearly, while
 * the largest landforms stay gentle enough for a road at grade to climb.
 *
 * Deterministic and analytic: no array, no seeding step, identical in the
