/**
 * THE WORLD'S DIARY OF CHANGES: what changed, where, and why - one record for
 * the whole game (the player, 2026-10-08: "se algo muda tem que saber o que
 * mudou, onde, etc."; "as estradas mudam terreno, ninguém sabe como, onde,
 * por quê").
 *
 * Before it, some twenty revision counters on the document said only THAT
 * something of a kind changed somewhere, and every system found out what by
 * digesting the whole map again; one of those findings was wrong for months
 * (the natural ground moved whenever a road shaped the drawn one, and every
 * road was solved and paved again: docs/PROBLEMAS.md P12) and nothing showed
 * it.
 *
 * An entry is an EVENT - what already happened, its data captured when it is
 * written (Nystrom, "Event Queue") - with the rectangles it happened in and
 * its cause: the tool and gesture for an edit of the document, or the entry it
 * follows from for what the game derives (the roads' heights solved, the
 * ground cut and filled, the land relit, the road tiles built), so every
 * change can be traced back to the edit that made it. Nobody is called when
 * one is written: whoever depends on a kind of change reads the entries since
 * the serial it last saw (`since`, `touches`), as `render/groundChanges.ts`
 * already did for the drawn ground - no listener to forget to unregister
 * (Nystrom, "Observer": the lapsed listener), no global bus (the diary belongs
 * to the document), and every change goes through one place (Nystrom, "Dirty
 * Flag": the flag a path forgets to set is the bug).
 *
 * Pure: no three, no DOM.
