 *     crosswalk          trim + setback + depth/2

 * distances — the lanelet builder, the sidewalk graph, the painter — imports it

 * Getting this order wrong is not cosmetic. If the stop line coincides with the
 * junction mouth there is no room for a crossing in front of it, and any kerb
 * placed for that crossing lands inside the carriageway.
