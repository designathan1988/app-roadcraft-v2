/**
 * THE PLANET'S ATLAS: the sphere is the world, and every point of it is
 * written on the map of the piece that owns it (`core/planetTiles.ts`): one
 * exact, reversible code for a point of the sphere. The pieces' maps are laid
 * side by side on one plane only as an address book - each cell of the plane
 * is one piece's map, and neighbours on the sphere need not be neighbours here.
 *
 * The maps are the charts of an atlas of OVERLAPPING charts (a manifold's
 * atlas, its transition maps through the sphere): what is worked out for a
 * piece is worked out on its map with everything within `TILE_REACH` of it
 * brought onto that map, so nothing is ever cut at a border.
 *
 * `3 x TILES_PER_SIDE` pieces a row, `2 x TILES_PER_SIDE` rows,
 * `ATLAS_PITCH` between centres: the gutter round a piece holds what reaches
 * past its border. Every centre on a multiple of 400 world units, so the
 * terrain's 16-unit grid, the grid's 25 and the plants' 12.5 fall on the same
 * lines in every piece.
