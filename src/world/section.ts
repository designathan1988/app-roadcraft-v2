/**
 * THE CROSS-SECTION OF A ROAD: what lies where across it, from the centreline
 * out, as named bands. The one description every consumer reads.
 *
 * It used to exist only implicitly. The carriageway, kerb and footway were
 * drawn as rings of decreasing half-width (`roadTypes.halfWidth`), unioned
 * per surface level and subtracted one from another (`surfaces.bands`); the
 * footway was what was LEFT OVER. Every pedestrian model then had to
 * reconstruct a walking path from that leftover - the sidewalk graph by
 * sampling its corners (centimetre reversals), the navigation mesh by eroding
 * it (an 11 cm sliver strip of kerb stone along every footway) - and both
 * walked erratically for it (study of 2026-10-01).
 *
 * Here the footway is an object with zones, as street design guides describe
 * a sidewalk (NACTO Urban Street Design Guide, "Sidewalks": frontage zone,
 * pedestrian through zone, street furniture/curb zone): the kerb stone at the
 * carriageway edge, a furnishing zone beside it where lamp columns, street
 * trees, benches and bins stand, the through zone people walk in, and a
 * frontage zone along the outer edge where the footway is wide enough to have
 * one. Vehicle lanes are bands of the
 * same section (OpenDRIVE lanes, Cities: Skylines lanes).
 *
 * Offsets are distances from the road centreline, world units, measured
 * outward on either side; the section is symmetric today (`RoadType` has one
 * footway width for both sides), so one `SideZones` describes both.
