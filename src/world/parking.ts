/**
 * On-street parking: a native part of a road's cross-section.
 *
 * A parking lane lies between the travel lanes and the kerb, on either side
 * of the road, and is chosen per segment. It is counted into the carriageway
 * (kerb face to kerb face), so a street with parking is wider kerb to kerb and
 * its travel lanes sit where they always did, inside the parking lanes.
 *
 * Cars park along the line of the street, beside the kerb, as they do on a
 * real street: bays are parallel to the kerb and follow the road round its
 * curves (the player's decision of 2026-10-05; bays across the kerb, at 45 or
 * 90 degrees, are not offered). Every measure is in whole metres of the
 * universal grid (`grid.ts`): the lane 2 m deep, bays 6 m long (Brazilian
 * standard 2.3 x 5.5).
 *
 * Bays stop short of every corner (`CORNER_CLEAR`, CTB art. 181 I: no parking
 * within 5 m of the cross street's kerb line), of crossings and of lot
 * entrances; that is laid out in `parkingLayout.ts`.
