 * Ground the player paints over the terrain: sand, soil, meadow, snow,
 * gravel, asphalt, concrete - and grass, which paints the others away - and
 * the COVERS, painted as a density and planted by the renderer
 * (`render/terrain.ts` keeps it, `render/renderer.ts` plants it): forest
 * (trees with an understorey), scrub (low bush), flowers and rocks - and the
 * GEOLOGY: which rock the land is made of where it breaks out on a slope
 * (granite, sandstone, basalt; granite where nothing was painted). A biome
 * layer of a terrain auto-material: painted once, every cliff in it takes
 * that rock (Brushify's biome layers; Terrain3D's per-vertex texture id).
 *
 * Texture splatting, as engines store painted terrain layers: a weight per
 * layer per texel, four layers to an RGBA texture, the weights summing to at
 * most one and the terrain's own grass showing through the rest
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_splatting). The document keeps the
 * DABS (where, how wide, how strong, which layer), so a painted map saves,
 * loads and undoes like the land stamps; the renderer rasterises them into
 * the weight textures (`render/terrain.ts`). Painting moves no height, so it
 * re-solves no road.
