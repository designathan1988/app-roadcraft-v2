/**
 * The overhead utility network: poles, the wires strung between them, and the
 * lamps they carry.
 *
 * It is a SECOND drawable graph, deliberately much simpler than the road one.
 * A pole has no width, so there is no casing, no junction, no trim and no
 * elevation solve — a pole stands on whatever is under it and a wire hangs
 * between two of them. Everything in this file is pure geometry and numbers;
 * the meshes live in `src/render/utilities.ts`, and nothing here knows what
 * three.js is.
 *
 * The one piece of real modelling is the wire. A cable hanging under its own
 * weight is a CATENARY, not a straight line and not a parabola, and the sag is
 * the whole reason a pole line reads as wiring rather than as a row of sticks.
