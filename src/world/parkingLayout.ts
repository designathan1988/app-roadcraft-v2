/**
 * Where the parking bays of every street lie, and the paint that marks them.
 *
 * A bay is laid out on the road's own centreline frame, so it follows a curve
 * as the kerb does: its kerb edge on the kerb face, its inner edge on the
 * parking lane's line, both stationed along the road. Runs of bays stop
 *
 * - 5 m short of a junction's kerb line (CTB art. 181 I) and clear of the
 *   crossing in front of it, so no bay reaches a corner, a zebra or the
 *   junction itself;
 * - in front of a lot that has parking of its own: that frontage is its
 *   entrance and stays clear for the cars going in and out.
 *
 * Bays lie along the kerb, as cars park on a real street, and are whole: a
 * run is a whole number of 6 m bays, centred in the room it has. The paint is
 * the MER of the Brazilian manual (MBST vol. IV, 7.3, "estacionamento simples
 * paralelo ao meio-fio com demarcação ao longo do trecho"): a DASHED white line
 * along the lane's inner edge (the player's order of 2026-10-05), closed
 * across the lane at each end of the run, and a continuous division line
 * across the lane between every two bays ("com delimitação de cada vaga"),
 * which the player also asked for. Where
 * parking is forbidden beside a parking lane, a continuous yellow line (LPP) is
 * painted along the kerb.
