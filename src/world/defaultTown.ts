/**
 * THE TOWN THE GAME OPENS ON.
 *
 * A small town, planned rather than scattered: one avenue as its spine, the
 * shops and the square on that spine, neighbourhoods of houses and terraces
 * behind them, a school and a park between the two, and the works - the
 * factory, the yards, the warehouses - on the flat ground by the water at the
 * edge, where industry belongs. Hills to the west and north, a ridge behind
 * the town, a stream along the east: the land the town was built in, not a
 * plate the town was poured onto.
 *
 * ## How it is planned (in the order a town is really planned)
 *
 * 1. `layLandform` - the ground first: the shelf the town stands on, the
 *    hills and the ridge that frame it, the stream and its valley.
 * 2. `layStreets` - the avenue east to west, the cross streets that make
 *    blocks, the road out to the works, the bridge over the stream.
 * 3. `occupy` - what stands on each block: the shops on the avenue, the
 *    square, the houses of the residential blocks, the school, the park, the
 *    works.
 * 4. `dress` - the boundaries (hedges, fences, walls), the poles and wires.
 *
 * Streets and blocks come BEFORE anything is placed on them, which is why
 * the grid is a table of node lines rather than a list of buildings: a block
 * is the rectangle between four lines, and what goes on it is decided from
 * its own size, frontage by frontage, the way `town.ts` does it.
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic (one seeded stream), so the same town
 * opens every time.
 */

 *
 * The avenue is `y = 0`. The streets either side are at ±210 units - the first
 * row of blocks each way - and the outer pair at ±420 units.
