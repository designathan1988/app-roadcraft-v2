/**
 * ELEMENTS: the small things a scene is dressed with, laid by a brush -
 * stones, pebbles and gravel, fallen leaves, grass, tall grass, scrub, ferns,
 * clover, flowers and mushrooms; and EFFECTS that live where they are laid -
 * smoke, fire, steam, dust, soot, sparks and spray. The brush works as an
 * engine's foliage painter does (Unreal's Foliage mode: a density per area,
 * a minimum distance between instances, a scale range, random turn, paint
 * and erase), and the document keeps every INSTANCE it laid, so a dressed
 * map saves, loads and undoes like any other edit; the renderer draws them
 * (`render/elements.ts`).
