/**
 * WHERE PEOPLE WALK, as lanes: the pedestrian network of the city.
 *
 * Built from the cross-section (`section.ts`) and the junctions, the way a
 * traffic simulator builds it (SUMO: sidewalks are lanes, "walkingareas" join
 * them at a junction's corners, "crossings" take them over the carriageway):
 *
 *  - a FOOTWAY runs down the middle of the through zone on each side of a
 *    road, from one junction mouth to the other;
 *  - a CORNER joins, round each corner of a junction, the footway that leaves
 *    it on one leg to the footway on the next: the two walking lines
 *    filleted about the kerb return's own centre, so the line keeps its
 *    distance from the kerb all the way round. Where a road only bends (a
 *    node of two legs and no junction) a short corner joins its two halves;
 *  - a CROSSING runs over the carriageway on the zebra, from one footway (or
 *    corner) to the other side's.
 *
 * Walkways are joined by TOPOLOGY - the ends of footways at the same road
 * node, on the same side - never by being close: a footway on a viaduct
 * passes over one on the ground without touching it, and a footway on a ramp
 * joins the one at its foot.
 *
 * Every walkway is a centreline with a usable width. A person walks ALONG
 * one, at a distance `s` that only grows, and keeps a lateral offset within
 * its width: there is no point to overshoot and no corner to choose. The two
 * pedestrian models before this one each rebuilt their paths from the paving
 * left over by polygon booleans, and both walked erratically for it (study
 * of 2026-10-01).
