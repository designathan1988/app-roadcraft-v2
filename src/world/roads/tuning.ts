/**
 * THE ROAD TUNING: every figure the road system is tuned by, in one place
 * (docs/VIAS.md, stage V0). Grades are rise over run; lengths and heights
 * are world units (`m()` turns a metre figure into them, 1 u = 0.4 m).
 *
 * Two kinds of entry, never mixed up:
 *  - LIVE: a figure the game runs on today. It holds exactly the number the
 *    code had before this file existed (the tests in
 *    `tests/world/roadTuning.spec.ts` lock them); where the real-world
 *    reference differs it is written beside it as `reference`, and changing
 *    the live figure is the player's decision, not a refactor's.
 *  - NOT LIVE YET: a figure for a stage still to come (`bridge`, `tunnel.minCover`,
 *    `piers.reference`, `flow`), kept here so that stage starts from a sourced number.
