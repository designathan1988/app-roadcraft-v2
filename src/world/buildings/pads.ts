/**
 * The ground graded to every building: a level platform under it, and a bank
 * at about one in three and a half from its edge back to the land - gentle
 * enough to stay grassed rather than bare soil.
 *
 * This is what a site on a slope actually gets, and what city builders do: the
 * TERRAIN is cut and filled, so the building stands on level ground and the
 * land meets it as a grassed slope. The old answer drew the difference as part
 * of the building - a stone plinth wall on the low side, with flights of steps
 * down it - which is what a builder does only where there is no room for a bank.
 *
 * The platform stands at the floor less the plinth, and the floor is worked out
 * on the NATURAL ground. Drawn on the graded ground, the same rule finds the
 * platform under the whole footprint and puts the floor back where it was: the
 * grading never feeds on itself.
