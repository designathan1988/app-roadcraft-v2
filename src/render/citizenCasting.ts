 * passenger, a rider, somebody stepping out at the kerb, a figure recycled
 * from the pool or brought back by loading a save - gets its body from
 * `pickCitizenModel`, and nothing else reads the roster
 * (`tests/arch/citizenCasting.spec.ts` fails if another module does).
 *
 * The roster is the reviewed manifest (`citizens.manifest.json`), classified
 * BY EYE from the contact sheets (`scripts/contact-sheet.mjs`): what a model
 * is dressed in, its apparent age and sex, and whether it may be in the
 * street at all. The whitelist FAILS CLOSED: a model with no entry, a missing
 * tag, a uniform (police, security, navy, pilot, medical, site worker, chef,
 * gardener, a football kit, a waiter's waistcoat) or a rejected model is not
 * in it, is never loaded, and is never drawn.
 *
 * A group is dressed to ONE code - a set of wardrobes that go together -
 * and every member is drawn from inside it, never outside: a suit beside a
 * track jacket, or a nurse beside a man in a T-shirt, cannot happen. When a
 * member cannot be dressed in a code, the code changes; the wardrobe never
 * relaxes.
