/**
 * Physical traffic signal heads.
 *
 * ## Why every head is double-sided
 *
 * A real signal aims its lenses at the traffic it controls and shows the
 * approach behind it nothing but a black box. That is correct on a street and
 * wrong in this game: the camera is locked to one isometric diagonal, so at any
 * junction roughly half the heads faced away and the player saw unlit boxes. A
 * player looking at a junction where every visible head was a dark rectangle
 * reported, reasonably, that the signals "have no green or amber light".
 *
 * So each head carries a lens cluster on BOTH faces of its housing. The pair is
 * driven from one state, which is also what a real repeater head does, and it
 * costs three extra discs per head.
 *
 * ## Why a dark lens is still coloured
 *
 * The unlit lenses used to be almost black — 0x42110f against a 0x101410
 * housing — so a head showed one glowing dot and nothing else, and the other
 * two colours were invisible rather than merely off. A real lens is a coloured
 * filter over a dark can: you can see it is red, amber and green from across a
 * junction with the lamp out. The dark materials here keep their hue and a
 * faint emissive floor, so all three lenses read at a glance and the lit one is
 * unmistakably the one that is on.
 *
 * ## The lit lamp
 *
 * Emissive, unlit, and NOT tone mapped. Everything else in the scene goes
 * through ACES, which rolls a bright saturated colour towards white; a signal
 * lamp is one of the few things that must keep its hue at full brightness, the
 * same argument that makes vehicle lamps and street lights basic materials.
 * A larger, dimmer halo disc sits behind the lens so the lamp reads as a source
 * rather than as a painted dot.
