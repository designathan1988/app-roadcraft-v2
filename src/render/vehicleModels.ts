/**
 * Vehicle bodies, built once per class from the class's own proportions.
 *
 * A body is drawn the way a car is designed, from a SIDE PROFILE, and then
 * split the way a car is built:
 *
 *  - the LOWER BODY is one outline - bumper, bonnet, waist, boot, sills, wheel
 *    arches - described as a bottom line and a top line, both monotone along
 *    the car. Any stretch of it is then a simple polygon (`outline`), so the
 *    nose, the tail, a door and the sill below it are cut from the same line
 *    and meet exactly; a door whose trailing edge runs over the rear wheel
 *    takes the arch out of its own bottom edge instead of crossing it.
 *  - with every door shut the lower body is ONE extrusion with its cabin top
 *    taken out (`hollow`): a continuous, bevelled side with no gaps, shut
 *    lines drawn on it. While a door moves the body is drawn in pieces
 *    instead - nose, tail, sill and the separate door leaves on their hinges.
 *  - above the waist the GREENHOUSE is a lofted surface - windscreen, roof,
 *    rear window - between two side planes that lean in towards the roof
 *    (tumblehome), with the pillars and the side glass cut from those planes.
 *    From the camera's 48 degrees the leaning glass faces up at the viewer,
 *    and the people inside are what is seen through it.
 *  - inside there is a finished cabin: carpet, a dashboard across the car with
 *    its binnacle and centre console, bucket seats and a rear bench with
 *    headrests, door cards with armrests, a parcel shelf or a boot floor.
 *
 * Buses and trucks are built with the same helpers (`buildBusModel`,
 * `buildTruckModel`): a low-floor bus with rows of seats, stanchions, a
 * driver's cab and sliding plug doors; a cab-over truck with a cab you can
 * see into, a chassis and a box body.
 *
 * Geometry is in world units, in the vehicle's frame: X forward, Y up, Z to the
 * vehicle's RIGHT, origin on the road under the middle of the body. Every
 * part carries a vertex colour that MULTIPLIES the instance colour (white keeps
 * the paint; dark gives black trim, rubber or a black-out pillar), so a body
 * is one draw per material whatever it depicts.
