 * THE TREES of the countryside and the planted ones: the cypress, the palm

 * style (`lowPolyTrees.ts`), the same the city's street and garden trees
 * are - low-poly, faceted, each face its own shade.
 *
 * One model a tree, whatever the distance: the levels of detail of the old
 * kit changed a tree's shape before the player's eyes ("ainda tem lod"), and
 * few trees stand on a map now (`renderer.ts` NATURE_TREES), so the whole
 * model is drawn everywhere.
 *
 * Each stands as its neighbours let it, as trees in a stand grow competing
 * for light and space (Runions et al., "Modeling Trees with a Space
 * Colonization Algorithm"; Palubicki et al., "Self-organizing tree models",
 * SIGGRAPH 2009): in the heart of a wood taller and narrower, at its edge and
 * alone broader, the crown leaning out towards the open side.
