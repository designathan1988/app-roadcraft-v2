/**
 * What a pedestrian's legs play, decided from what the simulation says the
 * body is doing — and nothing else. No bone, mesh or texture is touched here;
 * `riggedCitizens.ts` bakes the clips and blends what this returns, and the
 * tests drive this directly against the real simulation (`citizenGait.spec`).
 *
 * THE BODY MOVES, SO THE LEGS STEP. The speed the gait reads is the speed
 * the DRAWN body moves at: the simulation's own tick-to-tick displacement,
 * which already holds the walk along the footway, a step aside, the catch-up
 * after a change of edge and the steps to and from a bench. Reading the
 * forward speed alone, every one of those moved a figure standing in its idle
 * pose — a ghost sliding over the pavement — and a walk stop that had played
 * out left the body gliding on at half a metre a second with its feet
 * together.
 *
 * STEPS SHORTEN WITH PACE. A person walking slowly takes shorter steps at a
 * slower cadence, not the same step slowed down. The neutral walk used to be
 * the only cycle and its stride fixed, so somebody at 0.4 m/s played it at a
 * third of its speed: slow motion. Now three captures are blended on one
 * shared phase by speed — a shuffle (the slow walk with its swing shrunk), the
 * Rocketbox slow walk, and the neutral walk (an older person's version of it
 * for elders) — each at its own natural pace, and between two of them the
 * stride is interpolated, so the cadence stays in the range a person has.
 *
 * TURNS ARE STEPPED. Turning on the spot plays the turn clips, advanced by the
 * angle the body turns, whatever else was playing; a turn made while barely
 * moving adds its footwork to the cadence. The finish of a walk stop used to
 * take precedence, and the figure swivelled on motionless legs to face a
 * crossing.
 *
 * DIRECTION BELONGS TO THE FEET. Sideways and backward displacement blends
 * directional steps while the torso follows the published visual heading.
 * Shortening a stride also blends its pose towards the mean walking stance;
 * changing only the cycle's distance would leave full-length feet skating.
