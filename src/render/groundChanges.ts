/**
 * Where the drawn ground changed, and when: the one record everything that
 * stands on the ground reads to know whether it must be built again.
 *
 * Before it, the things on the ground (walls, the transport, gardens, the
 * forest, the buildings, the plants under them) were keyed on two global
 * counters - every world rebuild and every grading anywhere - so one street
 * drawn rebuilt all of them across the whole map, even with nothing near the
 * street, even with nothing at all (the empty trains mesh relinked its shader
 * on every road edit: docs/performance.md). Now a change is recorded with the
 * rectangle it happened in (the blocks the road solve moved, the region the
 * ground was cut and filled in, a building's bank), and a dependant is built
 * again only when its own data changed or a change since its last build
 * touches the area it stands on. A dependant with nothing to draw has no area
 * and is never built again for the ground.
