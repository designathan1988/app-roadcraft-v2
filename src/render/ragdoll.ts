/**
 * Ragdolls: people knocked over or killed by a blow, or tripping, their own
 * bodies falling.
 *
 * Jakobsen's method, as Hitman's dead bodies were done ("Advanced Character
 * Physics", GDC 2001): the skeleton is a stick figure of particles at the
 * joints - pelvis, chest, neck, head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees,
 * ankles, toes - moved by Verlet integration and held together by distance
 * constraints relaxed several times a step: rigid sticks for the bones and a
 * braced torso, ranges for what a joint allows (a knee folds only so far, and
 * only forwards; an elbow only backwards; the head does not fold into the
 * chest). Collisions are projections: a particle below the ground, inside a
 * wall or under a roof is put back on its surface and loses most of its speed
 * into it and some along it (friction). Every bone of the real skeleton is
 * then turned and placed from the particles - each limb's frame derived from
 * its particles with cross products, so knees and elbows bend the way the
 * particles do - and its skin matrix written into the body's palette: the
 * person's own mesh, clothes and hair tumble with arms and legs loose, strike
 * walls and the ground, and come to rest sprawled where they fell.
 *
 * The dead never get up. Right under a blow a body is torn apart: sticks are
 * broken (the head, an arm at the shoulder, a leg at the hip) and each piece
 * flies on its own, spraying blood; a piece is drawn as the whole body with
 * every bone not on it shrunk to the joint it was torn from, so the stump
 * closes. Bodies lie in their blood for a few minutes, then sink away.
 *
 * The living - knocked over by a blast, or tripping on the pavement - lie
 * dazed a moment, then get up the way games bring a ragdoll back to its feet
 * (blend the lying pose into the first frame of a get-up animation, then
 * play it): into a crouch over a short blend, then the crouch-to-stand clip,
 * where the body lies; the simulation is told where (`getUp`), and they run.
