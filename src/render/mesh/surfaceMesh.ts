/**
 * Turns a clipped surface band into a solid, watertight mesh.
 *
 * ## The two failures this module exists to prevent
 *
 * **Chords under the ground.** A deck vertex reads the height field only AT
 * ITSELF, and the triangle between two vertices is a straight chord. If that
 * chord is long and the surface it follows is curved, the chord dives beneath
 * the surface: the terrain cuts the road into plates. Densifying only the
 * polygon OUTLINE does not fix it, because ear clipping happily draws a single
 * triangle straight across a 60-unit boulevard. The fix is to refine the
 * TRIANGULATION until no edge is longer than `maxEdge`.
 *
 * **Cracks from a T-junction.** Refining each triangle on its own splits an
 * edge that its neighbour leaves whole, and the two no longer meet: a hairline
 * of background shows through. The refinement below is therefore done with
 * shared, cached edge midpoints and the standard red/green rule — a triangle
 * with one, two or three marked edges is split into two, three or four — so
 * every shared edge is split identically from both sides and no T-junction can
 * ever appear.

 *
 * Bisecting the longest edge halves it instead, doubling only the triangles
 * that were actually too big, and leaves well-shaped triangles alone. The same

 * Cuts a polygon down until no piece is wider than `span` in either axis.

 * ## Why this is here, and why it is not optional
 *
 * Ear clipping is a triangulation, not a MESHING, algorithm: it guarantees a
 * valid cover and says nothing about triangle shape. On a long thin band — a
 * road's 1400-by-1.5 verge — it emits a fan, and measured on exactly that
 * shape every one of the 352 triangles it returned had an edge up to 1392 units
 * long. No refinement can recover cheaply from that: bisecting a sliver whose
 * long edge is shared by its neighbour cascades, and the same strip refined to
 * an 8-unit edge cost 274 000 triangles for 2 100 square units of surface.
 *
 * Cutting first fixes the cause instead of paying for the symptom. Each piece is
 * compact, so earcut's worst output inside one is its diagonal, and the
 * refinement afterwards has three or four halvings to do rather than eight.
 *
 * The cut is a recursive bisection along the longer axis rather than a sweep
 * over a grid, so the clipper does `O(log n)` passes over the polygon instead of
 * one pass per cell — the difference between a fraction of a second and several
 * seconds on a city-sized network.
