# src/render — everything three.js

Rules for the whole repository are in the root `CLAUDE.md`. Nothing outside this
folder imports `three`. This file lists what breaks far from where you edit here.

## Couplings

1. **The asphalt shader** (`materials.ts`, `ROAD_SPACE_FRAGMENT`) assumes
   `uv.x * ASPHALT_TILE` is the across direction of `world/elevation.roadAt`.
2. **Shadow bias is in world units over the fitted depth range**
   (`environment.ts` `fitDepth`); change the range and the bias follows.
3. **`SUN_AZIMUTH` against the camera's azimuth** decides whether shadows are
   visible at all: with the sun opposite the camera every shadow falls behind its
   own caster.
4. **Instance buffers** in `agents.ts` are sized by `FLEET_CEILING` and
   `PED_CEILING` (`sim/params.ts`).
5. **Door edges** in `vehicleModels.ts` must agree with the seat count in
   `sim/vehicles/kerbStops.ts`.

## Traps that have already caught someone

- **Winding.** World `y` is mirrored into three's `z`, which flips handedness.
  `mesh/surfaceMesh.ts` measures each ring's signed area instead of assuming;
  assuming once back-face culled the whole road network.
- **Ear clipping fans.** `earcut` on a long thin band makes triangles with
  1400-unit edges. `splitToSpan` cuts the polygon first; never feed it a long one.
- **`shadowMap.enabled` is a quality tier setting.** If shadows stop working, check
  the tier first.
- **Textures are baked once** (`materials.ts`, `mesh/textureBaker.ts` cache by key).
  Never create a material inside a rebuild.
- **Repeated parts are instanced, never one object each.** Signal heads as single
  meshes cost over a thousand draw calls a frame. A material shared by instanced
  meshes must see all of them with the same program variant (all with instance
  colours or none, never also a plain mesh), and a transparent DoubleSide
  material needs `forceSinglePass`, or three re-evaluates its program every draw.
- **A vertex colour attribute does nothing unless the material sets
  `vertexColors: true`.** If a per-vertex tint has no effect, check the material
  before the maths.
- **Shader variants must be compiled for the target they draw to.**
  `compileAsync` runs with the renderer target set to the post-processing target
  (linear, no tone mapping), or it builds the wrong variants and the first frame
  stalls.
- **A seated person must fit the seat.** Car-seat poses are IK poses sized by
  `seatFitScale` against measured extents. After changing a body profile or a
  pose, rerun `scripts/measure-seated-poses.mjs` (against `npm run dev`) and
  `tests/render/occupantFit.spec.ts`.
- **People are MakeHuman bodies cooked ahead** (`cooked/people`, gitignored).
  After any change to people code or assets the cook fingerprint changes and
  bodies are built slowly at runtime until `npm run cook:people` runs again.
  The procedural crowd's cook (`cooked/procedural`) is fingerprinted by the
  import closure of `people/proceduralBake.ts` only: changing how the crowd
  is drawn (`proceduralCrowd.ts`, `crowd*.ts`) does not stale it; changing
  the bake or what it imports does.
- **The procedural people's skeletons are drawn on the GPU** (`people/
  crowdAnimation.ts`): `renderPalettes(renderer)` must run after the crowd's
  `update` and before the scene is drawn (`renderer.ts` before `post.render`,
  `peopleLab.ts`), or people are drawn in the last pose rendered.
- **A procedural person's level of detail comes from `person.pixels`**
  (`agents.ts` from `personPixels`); unset, they are drawn in full.
- **Main-thread JavaScript, not the GPU, was the frame cost** in the 2026-10-02
  profile. Profile before optimising the GPU side.

## How to add a visual effect

Put it in `postprocess.ts` behind a flag in `quality.ts`, so a weak machine can turn
it off. Never add an unconditional cost.
