/**
 * HOW BRIGHT EACH KIND OF LIGHT IS AFTER DARK, in one place.
 *
 * A light is drawn with a luminance (linear, Rec. 709 weights, the bloom's own
 * measure) where 1 is a white surface in full light. The bloom
 * (`postprocess.ts`) spills only what is above `BLOOM_THRESHOLD`: a light
 * source must be drawn brighter than any lit surface, in the HDR buffer, or it
 * does not glow (learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom).
 *
 * Lit windows, tail lamps and brake lamps were drawn at 0.3, 0.84 and 0.75:
 * none glowed, and the brakes were dimmer than the tail lamps. One scalar
 * brightened every lamp of a vehicle alike, so a saturated red reached a
 * quarter of the luminance a white lamp did, and an unlit lamp or a number
 * plate glowed with the rest.
 *
 * Vehicle lamps follow their luminous intensity, in a perceptual (log)
 * scale anchored on the bloom threshold: L = 0.92 + 0.7 log10(I / 3 cd).
 * UN R7 6.1: a rear position lamp R1 4-17 cd, a stop lamp S1 60-260 cd
 * (lexaris.de/book/version/documentflat/head/2059171); a rear indicator,
 * UN R6 category 2, 50-200 cd (treaties.un.org, UNTS vol. 607, A-4789). The
 * headlamps keep the 3.0 they were drawn at.
