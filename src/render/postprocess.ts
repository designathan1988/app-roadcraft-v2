/**
 * The post chain: ambient occlusion, then anti-aliasing, then tone mapping.
 *
 * ## Why ambient occlusion earns its cost here
 *
 * Nearly every contact in this scene is a flat surface meeting another flat
 * surface at a small height difference — asphalt to kerb, kerb to footway,
 * footway to verge, a pier standing on the ground, a deck over a road. Direct
 * light cannot describe any of those: the two surfaces face the same way, so
 * they take the same amount of sun and the edge between them vanishes. Ground
 * truth ambient occlusion darkens exactly those creases, and it is the single
 * change that makes the road read as built into the ground rather than printed
 * on it.
 *
 * ## MSAA and SMAA
 *
 * The composer's half-float target is multisampled (4x where the GPU allows):
 * thin geometry - lane lines, kerbs, a road's edge seen from afar - is sampled
 * at every pixel it crosses. SMAA then runs on the resolved image, one pass,
 * and - unlike FXAA - keeps the thin bright lines of lane markings sharp
 * instead of smearing them.
 *
 * At the lowest quality tier the composer is skipped entirely and the scene is
 * drawn straight to the canvas with the driver's own MSAA, which is what keeps a
 * weak GPU playable.
