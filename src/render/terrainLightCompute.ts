/**
 * THE LAND'S OWN LIGHT, from its heights alone (`terrain.ts` draws it, the
 * worker in `terrainLight.worker.ts` works it out) - what makes a relief read
 * as one: the ground itself casts no shadow map (180 000 triangles drawn twice
 * a frame), so a chapada threw no shadow over the plain and a valley was as
 * bright as a ridge.
 *
 *  - SUN: from every corner a ray is marched towards the sun over the
 *    heightfield, keeping how near it passes over the ground for its distance
 *    (Inigo Quilez's soft shadows, min(k h / t)): fully lit, in the penumbra
 *    of a ridge, or behind it (the heightfield shadows of horizon and shadow
 *    height maps).
 *  - SKY: the horizon is found in eight directions round every corner and
 *    each direction sees 1 - sin^2 of it - three's GTAO integral for a surface
 *    seen from above - so valleys, hollows and the feet of walls see less sky.
 *
 * Worked out for the corners a change can reach and no others: a corner's
 * horizon depends only on the ground within its search (Stewart, "Fast
 * Horizon Computation at All Points of a Terrain With Visibility and
 * Shading Applications", TVCG 1997), so a road drawn relights the ground
 * round it, its sky's reach, and the band its relief can shade away from
 * the sun - as an engine refreshes a terrain's dirty region only (Unity,
 * `TerrainData.DirtyHeightmapRegion`). The whole map was lit again for every
 * quarter-block the ground was shaped in: fourteen times 120-220 ms for one
 * road (the player, 2026-10-08).
 *
 * Pure: no three, no DOM.
