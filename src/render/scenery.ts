/**
 * Everything standing on the ground that is not a road: street furniture,
 * street trees, vegetation and grass.
 *
 * There used to be a gantry arch at every map-edge stub, to mark where traffic
 * entered. It was a piece of scenery nobody asked for standing in the middle of
 * open country, and it is gone: a road that ends simply ends.
 *
 * Vegetation is here for a reason beyond decoration. An isometric view of an
 * open plain gives the eye nothing to judge distance or scale by, so the scene
 * reads as a flat map however good the ground material is. Objects of a KNOWN
 * height, scattered at a known density, are what turn the same image into a
 * landscape: they cast shadows across the terrain, they occlude one another with
 * distance, and they make a hill's far side legible.
 *
 * WHERE the furniture stands is not decided here: `world/streetFurniture.ts`
 * owns the layout, because the pedestrians have to walk around the same list.
 *
 * Everything is instanced — one draw call per model, whatever the count — and
 * every mesh carries a real bounding sphere so the frustum can reject it.
 * Models and materials live in a `SceneryKit` built once; a rebuild only
 * writes instance matrices.
