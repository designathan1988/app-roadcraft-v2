/**
 * River water: an extended `MeshStandardMaterial`, not a `ShaderMaterial`.
 *
 * The old surface was a flat blue disc at a fixed opacity, and every one of its
 * defects came from something it did not know:
 *
 *  - it did not move, so nothing told the eye it was liquid;
 *  - it did not know how deep it was, so the bank faded out at the same rate as
 *    the middle of the channel and the river had no visible bed and no shore;
 *  - it had one flat colour, so the only thing standing between it and painted
 *    card was the environment map.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * Everything here is folded into the standard material through
 * `onBeforeCompile`, so the water keeps the scene's lights, its PMREM
 * environment map, its shadows and its ACES tone mapping. A stand-alone
 * `ShaderMaterial` would have had to reimplement all four, and would have
 * drifted away from them at the first lighting change.
 *
 * Four things are injected:
 *
 *  1. **Two scrolling normal layers.** One baked, tiling normal map sampled
 *     twice — at two world scales, drifting in two directions at two speeds —
 *     and summed in tangent space. That is the whole of the motion; it is also
 *     the whole of the sparkle, because a low roughness plus a perturbed normal
 *     is what lets the low sun throw glints off the surface.
 *  2. **A depth tint**, read from the `aDepth` vertex attribute the geometry
 *     builder writes: the surface level minus the ground under it. Shallow water
 *     is lighter and greener and largely transparent, so the bed shows through
 *     near the bank; deep water is darker, bluer and nearly opaque. Uniform
 *     opacity is what used to make the whole river read as one sheet of plastic.
 *  3. **A widened Schlick term.** See `FRESNEL_POWER` for why it is not 5.
 *  4. **A shore foam band**, also driven by `aDepth`, broken up by a noise
 *     channel carried in the alpha of the same normal map so it does not read as
 *     a contour line.
 *
 * ## The cost
 *
 * Two `texture2D` fetches per pixel, from one sampler, and arithmetic. The foam
 * noise rides in the alpha channel of the normal map rather than in a texture of
 * its own precisely so that the count stays at two. Everything else the fragment
 * does is what a `MeshStandardMaterial` already did. There is no render target,
 * no reflection pass and no depth pre-pass: water covers a small part of an
 * isometric frame and does not deserve one.
 *
 * The normal map is baked procedurally into a `DataTexture` — no canvas, no
 * file, no fetch — which also means the bake is a pure function that a headless
 * test can check.
