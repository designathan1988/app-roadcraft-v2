/**
 * Poses for people sitting in and on vehicles, built on the citizens' own
 * skeleton by inverse kinematics.
 *
 * The seated clips the citizen assets ship with are CHAIR poses: measured on
 * the rig, the head is 0.91 m above the pelvis and the feet 0.54 m below it,
 * knees at a right angle. A car's cabin has 1.1 m between floor and roof
 * lining, so a driver in that pose had their head through the roof and their
 * feet through the floor. The captured sitting idle is no better on a bus:
 * its legs splay 0.36 m to the side, and a passenger by the window had a foot
 * through the bodywork.
 *
 * A pose here is a handful of TARGETS in the pelvis frame - where the feet,
 * the hands and the head have to be - and two-bone IK puts the limbs there on
 * whatever body is being baked. Distances are in metres, in the model's frame:
 * +Z forward, +Y up, +X to the body's left (the Rocketbox convention).
 *
 * Where a person touches a machine - the rim of a steering wheel, the grips
 * and pegs of a motorcycle, the bars and pedals of a bicycle - the place is
 * stated HERE, once (`DRIVER_WHEEL`, `CAB_WHEEL`, `MOTO_FIT`, `BIKE_FIT`),
 * and the vehicle models build those parts to it. The hands were 18 to 25 cm
 * off the grips while the two were written down separately.
 *
 * The poses are baked into bone palettes once per body, like every other clip
 * (`riggedCitizens.ts`); nothing here runs per frame. The small movements that
 * keep a seated person alive - a look in the mirror, out of the window, down
 * at a phone - are more still poses of the same seat, which the renderer
 * blends in and out per person (`occupants.ts`).
