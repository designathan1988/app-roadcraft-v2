/**
 * The scene renderer.
 *
 * ## The rebuild contract
 *
 * Everything derived from the road network or the terrain is rebuilt in exactly
 * one place, `rebuildWorld`, and only when one of the two revisions it watches
 * has moved. Nothing computes geometry inside `draw`. That matters because a
 * road rebuild solves the whole elevation field and re-triangulates every band:
 * doing it per frame was how earlier versions turned an edit into a stall.
 *
 * A terrain edit invalidates the roads too — they are laid ON the terrain — so
 * both revisions gate the same rebuild.
 *
 * ## Draw order
 *
 * 1. terrain (heightfield, water)
 * 2. road surfaces (four bands per structural level, plus markings)
 * 3. structure details (piers, parapets)
 * 4. scenery (furniture, trees, bushes; grass at close zoom only)
 * 5. agents and signal heads, resynced every frame from the simulation
