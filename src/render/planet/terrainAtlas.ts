/**
 * THE PLANET'S GROUND: the far globe at low detail in one draw
 * (`globeGround.ts`), and a full terrain plate - the flat map's own surface
 * (`terrain.ts`), handed its piece's share of the document in the piece's
 * own coordinates (`FaceSource`) - only for the pieces that need one.
 *
 * Each of the 864 pieces used to be a full surface from the boot: its mesh,
 * material and data textures, its ecosystem and light, and every per-frame
 * loop ran over all of them - the planet's memory, its opening and its frame
 * went on ground nobody was looking at. As planet renderers page their
 * terrain (Proland's tile cache: the fine level produced where the view
 * needs it, the coarse level drawn where it is missing; Cesium's quadtree the
 * same), a piece is kept in full while
 *  - something of the document lies on or reaches it (roads, buildings,
 *    lots, a stamp, a painted dab...): its ground must be the one they were
 *    built on, and it is never let go;
 *  - or it is near the ground the view takes in (Proland's split rule: a
 *    piece within some times its size of what the view looks at);
 * and piece 0 always (its surface lends the atlas its shared parts). A piece
 * no longer wanted stays cached (`CACHE`) and is let go the least recently
 * used first. Asked about a piece with no surface, the atlas answers from the
 * land itself (`planet/relief.ts`), as that piece's surface would.
 *
 * A stamp (or a painted dab) belongs to every piece its disc reaches on the
 * sphere, each given it on its own map (carried there through the sphere, not
 * by an offset), so a hill on a border rises the same on both sides.
