/**
 * THE FAR GLOBE'S GROUND: the whole planet's land at low detail, in one
 * geometry drawn with the terrain's own material (`terrainAtlas.ts`), under
 * the few pieces kept in full near the view or with something on them.
 *
 * As a planet renderer pages its terrain (Proland's tile producer and cache:
 * "it is not possible to store in GPU memory the whole landscape data", the
 * coarse level shown where the fine one is missing; Cesium's quadtree the
 * same), the 864 pieces are no longer each a full flat-map surface - 864
 * meshes, materials and data textures, every per-frame loop over all of them -
 * but a coarse patch each, here, in one draw.
 *
 * Each piece's patch is `PATCH` x `PATCH` quads over its square of the cube
 * face (`core/planetTiles.ts`), its corners written on the piece's own chart
 * (`world/planet/atlas.ts`): a patch lies inside its piece's cell of the
 * atlas, as the bend (`bend.ts` planetTile) and the terrain shader read it,
 * and two patches give their shared edge the same points of the sphere.
 * The heights are the land's own (`planet/relief.ts`, as an untouched piece
 * has it), lowered `SKIRT` along every edge (a skirt, as chunked terrain
 * hides the step where a coarse patch meets a finer piece).
