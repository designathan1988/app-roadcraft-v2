 * THE ONE TREE STYLE of the game: every tree and bush on the map - the
 * countryside's and the planted ones (`natureTrees.ts`), the street, lot and
 * garden trees (`propGeometry.ts`, drawn by `scenery.ts`) and the painted
 * woods' stand-ins (`groundCover.ts`) - is grown here, so a city park and the
 * wood beside it are one family (the player, 2026-10-08: three kits side by
 * side, "não tem padronização alguma").
 *
 * Built as games build light stylized trees (the player, 2026-10-08: "a
 * técnica de alpha, que faz ficar bem leve e bonita"): a low-poly trunk and a
 * small, dark inner crown - the shaded heart - covered by FOLIAGE CARDS:
 * quads of a leaf-cluster texture, alpha-cut, turned to face the eye
 * (billboards, so no card is ever seen edge-on), all lit with normals
 * pointing out from the crown's centre, so the canopy shades as one soft mass
 * (Polycount and SideFX on stylized foliage; the fluffy-tree write-ups of
 * Pontus Karlsson and Michael Dougall). The cut edge is smoothed by alpha to
 * coverage on the multisampled target (three: "smooth aliasing on
 * alphaTest-clipped edges"). Conifers too, their cards smaller towards the
 * tip. The palm's fronds are cards of their own kind: long strips laid along
 * each drooping frond, creased down the middle into a V (a straight centre
 * edge to fold the card along, edges across it to let it droop - Polycount on
 * leaf cards), carrying a pinnate frond cut by the same alpha; they lie in
 * the model, not turned to the eye (the faceted fronds read as the old trees
 * - the player, 2026-10-09).
 *
 * Proportions from a professional low-poly kit (Kenney's Nature Kit,
 * `public/models/nature/`: a crown 0.35 to 0.6 of the height across, a short
 * clear trunk). Colour: sRGB hex read ONCE into the linear working space
 * (three's colour management since r152).
 *
 * Every model is ONE unit tall with its root at the origin (the wind shader,
 * `wind.ts`, reads local y as the fraction of the height). The body is
 * non-indexed with position, normal and colour; the cards carry, besides,
 * a uv into the foliage atlas (`foliageAtlas`: the leaf cluster on its left
 * half, the palm frond on its right) and each corner's offset in the view's
 * plane (`aCorner`, nought on a frond strip).
