/**
 * The road network's surface bands, per structural level.
 *
 * ## Cross-section
 *
 * Every band sits at a fixed offset from ONE shared deck height, and each one
 * draws a skirt down to the band outside it. That is what turns four flat
 * ribbons into a built cross-section:
 *
 * ```
 *          footway  +0.36 ─────┐
 *   kerb face  ─────┐          │  (skirt down to the verge)
 *   asphalt  0.00 ──┘  +0.02   └── verge  -0.10
 * ```
 *
 * Because every offset is measured from the same `RoadElevation`, two bands can
 * never disagree about where the road is — the defect that left steps and gaps
 * between the carriageway and its kerb.
 *
 * ## Per-class colour, in one mesh
 *
 * A residential street is grey and a boulevard is near-black, but they share a
 * junction and therefore a polygon. The class tint is written per VERTEX from
 * the nearest road, so one asphalt mesh carries every class and the colour
 * blends where two classes meet instead of stopping at an invented seam.
