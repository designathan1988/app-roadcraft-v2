/**
 * Every material the scene uses, baked once and shared.
 *
 * A material here owns its textures. The road network is rebuilt on every edit,
 * and the previous code baked a fresh 160x160 canvas per band per structure on
 * each of those rebuilds — a stutter the player felt as a hitch while drawing.
 * Nothing in this module is rebuilt; the meshes are swapped and the materials
 * stay.
 *
 * ## Texture scale
 *
 * Each recipe declares the world size one tile covers. UVs are handed to the
 * mesh builder in WORLD UNITS, and the material divides by that world size, so
 * scale is stated once and can never drift between a road and the junction it
 * runs into. One world unit is 0.4 m, so asphalt aggregate at a 12-unit tile is
 * a 4.8 m repeat — close enough to a real surfacing course that the eye reads
 * texture rather than pattern.
 *
 * ## Close zoom
 *
 * The macro textures carry tone, wear, slabs and joints - everything visible
 * from the play zoom. The fine structure a player sees with the camera a few
 * metres off the ground (stones in the asphalt, sand in the concrete, blades in
 * the grass) comes from the detail layer in `mesh/detailLayer.ts`, which fades
 * in by pixel footprint. See that file for why a larger macro texture was not
 * the answer.
