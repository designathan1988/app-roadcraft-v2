/**
 * A ROAD EDIT WORKED OUT ON ONE CHART OF THE PLANET.
 *
 * Every point of the planet is written on the chart of the piece that owns
 * it (`world/planet/charts.ts`). A road drawn is worked out where it was
 * drawn: on the chart of the piece the gesture started on, which the gesture
 * was read on (`Viewport.holdChart`) and whose map goes on past its piece.
 * EVERY point of the working copy is brought onto that chart (`enterFrame`:
 * the same ground, other coordinates, no edit), the edit runs there with the
 * flat map's own code - crossings, splits, joins, heights, rules, price - and
 * every point is written back on its own piece's chart (`leaveFrame`), a node
 * the edit did not move getting its very coordinates back.
 *
 * Every point, not only those near the gesture: the flat code measures any
 * two points of the copy against each other (a road between two nodes, a
 * junction's legs, the price of every road), and two points written on two
 * different charts are ~30 km apart in the atlas when they are 500 m apart on
 * the sphere. Bringing only the roads round the gesture left a road with one
 * end brought and one not drawn straight across the atlas: a phantom tens of
 * km long that the gesture crossed - a junction with nothing, a crossing
 * refused as squeezed or overlapping, a price of hundreds of millions. It is
 * the rule PostGIS states for the same reason: an operation on two
 * geometries needs both in one spatial reference system, and geography's
 * planar operations (`ST_Buffer`) project ALL their input onto one plane,
 * work there and project back (https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html).
 * Far from the chart's centre its map stretches, but every rule and price is
 * differential (`editRules.ts`, `economy.ts`): what the edit did not touch
 * reads the same before and after it.
 *
 * On the flat map nothing here is called.
 */

/**
 * The longest road left in one segment on the planet: a segment is drawn on
 * the chart halfway along it (`world/geometry.ts` `segmentChart`), and a short
 * one stays close to it. Applied to the roads an edit laid, once its crossings
 * are made (`commit.ts` `cutLongRoads`).
