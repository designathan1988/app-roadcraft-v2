/**
 * What a road edit may not leave behind, judged on the network it builds.
 *
 * City builders refuse a placement the game cannot carry and say why, before
 * the mouse is let go: Cities: Skylines will not lay a road steeper than its
 * limit, nor a segment too short ("distance too short": intersections too
 * close together, a curve too sharp), nor a piece over something already
 * there. These are the same refusals for this game's geometry:
 *  - `sharp`: a node whose legs meet under `MIN_LEG_ANGLE` - the mark the game
 *    already shows as "cannot be built" (`Network.impossible`);
 *  - `squeezed`: a junction whose legs are too short to separate their lanes
 *    (`Network.squeezed`);
 *  - `overlap`: a road lying on another one with no junction between them and
 *    without the vertical room to pass over it;
 *  - `steep`: a road whose height change, over what the junction plates at its
 *    ends leave free, needs a grade no street is built at.
 * And `funds`, which is not geometry: an edit the balance cannot pay for
 * (`editor/roads/economy.ts`), judged after the rules above.
 *
 * Every rule is DIFFERENTIAL: an edit is refused for what IT created or made
 * worse, never for damage already on the map. Loading never refuses, so any
 * map may hold such places; judged absolutely, one of them would refuse every
 * road drawn anywhere afterwards (measured on the old sharp-node refusal: a
 * 7-degree node 5000 units away blocked a road at the origin).
