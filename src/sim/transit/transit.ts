/**
 * Public transport running (`world/transit.ts` laid out by the player).
 *
 * BUSES are vehicles of the traffic: each line puts its buses on the road at
 * its terminal (or its first stop), one after another, and each drives to the
 * lane beside its next stop (`Vehicle.commute`, as a resident's car drives to
 * the bay it parks at), stops there, opens its doors a while - longer at a
 * terminal - and goes on to the next, out along the line and back.
 *
 * TRAINS and the METRO run on their own tracks: the line's way out along its
 * stations and back is a loop of points (`railPath`); a train goes along it
 * at its speed, brakes for the next station, stands there with its doors
 * open, and keeps its distance to the train ahead.
 *
 * PASSENGERS are residents (`CityLife.start`): somebody without a car going
 * far, with a line from near where they are to near where they go, walks to
 * the stop, waits there, boards the first vehicle of the line that stops,
 * gets off at their stop and walks the rest. Nobody is made up.
