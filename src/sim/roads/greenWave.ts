/**
 * A GREEN WAVE along the main road through a junction (docs/VIAS.md V5): the
 * signals of the road, junction by junction, given one common cycle and each
 * an offset equal to the time a platoon takes to reach it at the road's
 * speed, so the platoon meets green at each in turn (the offset is distance
 * over platoon speed, t = L / S, on a common cycle; Wikipedia, "Green wave").
 * Each signal becomes fixed-time: the cycle is stretched to the longest
 * signal's by lengthening the main road's own stage; the player's bus
 * priority is kept. Returns the settings to give each junction, starting
 * with the one asked about; empty when the road has fewer than two signals.
