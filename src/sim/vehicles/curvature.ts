/**
 * How fast a driver is willing to take the road ahead, from its curvature.
 *
 * Nothing used to slow a vehicle for a bend. Turns through a junction took a
 * fixed share of the limit (`turnSpeedFactor`), and a curved road took none
 * at all: measured on a single bend of an urban street, vehicles pulled up to
 * 10 m/s² sideways, and on the saved player map 1 % of all vehicle samples
 * exceeded 1 g. The cap here is the one a driver actually applies - a
 * lateral acceleration they are comfortable with, `v = sqrt(a / curvature)`
 * at every point ahead, reached by braking comfortably from where they are.
 *
 * Curvature is measured over a chord a few metres long rather than at a
 * single vertex, so the kink between two segments of a flattened polyline is
 * not mistaken for a hairpin. Each lanelet's profile is computed once and
 * cached against the lanelet object, so it is rebuilt exactly when the
 * topology is.
