/**
 * Somebody getting out of a car at the kerb, or getting in.
 *
 * Every occupant used to be born inside a vehicle at the edge of the map and
 * to vanish with it at another edge: nobody was ever seen getting in or out,
 * and no door ever moved. A car now sometimes carries an ERRAND - drop a
 * passenger off, or pick somebody up - and runs it the way a driver does:
 *
 *   1. it picks a place in the kerb lane, well clear of junctions and
 *      crossings, where a footway runs beside the road;
 *   2. it brakes to a stop there (`kerbStopObstacle`, an ordinary obstacle,
 *      so traffic behind simply follows it down or overtakes);
 *   3. it waits until the swing of the door and the spot on the footway are
 *      clear of people - a door is not opened into somebody;
 *   4. the kerb-side door opens, the person moves between the seat and the
 *      footway, the door closes, and the car pulls away.
 *
 * A passenger dropped off becomes a pedestrian on the footway, walking on
 * from where they stood. A pick-up takes a real pedestrian walking alone near
 * the stop: they walk to the door and get in, and are removed from the
 * crowd when they sit down.
 *
 * A bus runs the same machinery as a SERVICE: at a stop, passengers alight
 * through the middle door and people waiting nearby board at the front, one
 * after another with the doors held open. A truck makes a DELIVERY: its mate
 * gets out on the kerb side, is gone for a few seconds with the load, and
 * gets back in. Each person is one task of the stop's queue.
 *
 * Doors and seats are indexed as the renderer's body model numbers them:
 * the driver's (left) side first, front to back, then the kerb (right) side;
 * each door serves the seat behind it. Only kerb-side doors are used here,
 * which in right-hand traffic is the side away from the traffic.
