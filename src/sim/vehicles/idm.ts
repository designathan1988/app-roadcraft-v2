 * Anything a vehicle must not run into: a leader, a red signal, a held

 * where the first `false` won regardless of severity, and no later gate could
 * soften an earlier one (defect 2). Here every restriction is the same shape,
 * they are combined with `min`, and `min` is commutative — so the order in
