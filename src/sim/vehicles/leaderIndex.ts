 * across a junction is the same loop as looking down a straight — there is no
 * special case, and a vehicle correctly slows for a queue on the far side of a
 * junction before entering it.
 *
 * The V6 monolith rebuilt a full occupancy map from scratch in six different
 * places every frame and scanned all vehicles per lane-head test (defect 5.7).
 * Here each lanelet keeps a sorted occupancy list maintained on entry and exit.
 *
 * Two kinds of body are in a lane without being in its occupancy list, and
 * both used to be driven into:
 *
 *   - a vehicle sliding OUT of the lane after a lane change (its `shadow`);
 *   - a vehicle that left the same stop line on a DIFFERENT movement and whose
 *     body still sweeps the shared start of both turns (`divergeObstacle`).
