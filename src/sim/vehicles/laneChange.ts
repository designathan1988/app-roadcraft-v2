 * Lane choice: the route's, and the driver's.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of change, and why they are not the same decision
 *
 * A **mandatory** change is one the route needs. Lane discipline in
 * `laneIsPlausible` makes each turn legal from exactly one lane — a right turn
 * only from the outermost, a left only from the innermost — which is what stops
 * a car crossing the carriageway to reach its turn. `planFrom` publishes
 * `desiredLane` once, when the movement is chosen, and this stage executes it.
 * It is deliberately NOT re-decided here: an earlier version re-scored lane
 * costs every link, and the whole fleet then migrated into whichever lane had
 * the cheaper turn menu — a standing queue emptied itself sideways instead of
 * discharging.
 *
 * A **discretionary** change is one the driver wants: the car in front is slow
 * and the next lane is clear. Without it every vehicle inherits the speed of
 * the slowest vehicle ahead of it for the length of the block, which is why a
 * bicycle on an avenue used to gather a silent procession of cars behind it.
 * This is what "overtake slow vehicles" means, and it is a different decision
 * with a different failure mode — oscillation rather than migration.
 *
 * ## MOBIL, and the three things that keep it from oscillating
 *
 * The incentive is the standard one: change if my acceleration improves by more
 * than a threshold, having weighted the two drivers I inconvenience by my own
 * politeness. Three guards turn it from a paper model into something shippable:
 *
 *  - a **refractory period**, because a driver sitting exactly on the threshold
 *    flips between two lanes every tick;
 *  - a **keep-to-the-kerb bias**, so the incentive is asymmetric and the fleet
 *    drains back outward instead of accumulating in the fast lane;
 *  - **no discretionary change on a junction approach**, because that is where
 *    mandatory changes need the room, and a driver weaving at a stop line is
 *    both wrong and the thing most likely to strand someone in the wrong lane.
 *
 * Both thresholds and the politeness are the DRIVER's, not constants, so one
 * car pulls out to pass where the one behind it waits.
 *
 * This stage never writes `lanelet`. It publishes `laneChange` when the move is
 * safe right now, and `integrate` — the only writer of position — performs it.
