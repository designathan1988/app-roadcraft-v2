/**
 * Cars that use the lots' car gates: in from the street, through the gate,
 * up the drive to a stall of the car park behind, a while parked, and out
 * through the same gate onto the street again.
 *
 * A lot's car park is a SUMO parking area: bound to the lane its access is on
 * (here the lane in front of the car gate, `parking.ts` `gateExits`), reached
 * by a stop on that lane, held for a `duration`, and left onto the lane at a
 * `departPos` of its own, a few metres past the gate. A car of the passing
 * traffic is given that stop: it pulls up a few metres before the gate
 * (`BayLane.entryAt`), leaves the lane and is driven off the road
 * (`manoeuvre.ts`) through the gate to the stall; parked, it is one of the
 * cars standing in bays (`AmbientWorld.parked`, which the renderer draws and
 * walkers keep off); leaving, it backs out, drives out of the gate, waits at
 * the kerb for a gap and joins the traffic again, bound for a road end like
 * any other car.
 *
 * THE LOTS MAKE THE TRIPS, as the buildings of Cities: Skylines send their
 * cars out and take them in: a car of the traffic ends its trip in a lot at
 * the rate a trip ends (`TRIP_SECONDS`), to a lot drawn by how many go in
 * at its kind of place at this hour (`ambient/demand.ts` flows); and while
 * fewer cars drive than the panel asks for (`trafficTarget`), cars standing
 * in the lots' bays - the scenery's, handed over (`AmbientWorld.release`),
 * or those parked here - drive out, drawn by how many come out of each kind
 * of place now. A town with no road leading off the map keeps its traffic
 * this way; the road ends bring theirs in and take it away as before.
 * Half the lots called are near the view, so the player sees them.
