/**
 * The way on foot between a lot's front door and the footway: from the door,
 * down the path to the people's gate in the front boundary, through the gate
 * and out onto the footway (`editor/lotPlan.ts` puts the gate on the path to
 * the door, the same x as the door, in every front with a garden or a
 * forecourt). As SUMO reaches a stop off the lane by its `<access>` (a lane, a
 * position on it, and the distance walked to the stop), the gate's foot on the
 * footway is where a walk from the street turns in, and the way through the
 * lot is walked as one more stretch of the route (`agents/walk.ts`, steps off
 * the walkways).
 *
 * Inside the lot the way is found on a person's grid (`lotNav.ts`
 * `PEOPLE_GRID`): the building, walls, fences, hedges, trees, benches, bins,
 * the car stalls are solid, stairs and ramps are not; the gate must be open to
 * that grid (a line from inside it to the footway crosses only free cells),
 * and the way is pulled taut. The last stretch runs square through the
 * middle of the gate, between its posts.
 *
 * Worked out once per building record (records are replaced on any change)
 * and only when a walker is first sent to or from that lot.
