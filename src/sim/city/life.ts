/**
 * The residents' days: The Sims inside SimCity.
 *
 * Everybody who lives in the city has a home, most adults a job, children a
 * school. In the morning they leave home and go to work - on foot, or by car
 * if they have one and it is far - go in, and stay; in the evening they come
 * home, and some go out again for a meal, a film, a walk in the park. The
 * traffic on the streets is theirs: with residents in the city nothing comes
 * in at the map's edges (`SimWorld.edgeTraffic`).
 *
 * A resident inside a building is not an agent: only the trips move. A walk
 * is a person on the footway, from one door to another (`PedestrianEngine.
 * walkTrip`); a drive is a car from the kerb outside one door to the kerb
 * outside the other, where it pulls in and is parked, and its driver walks
 * the last metres in.
