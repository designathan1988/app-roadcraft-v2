/**
 * The life of the scenery, as GTA makes it: nobody lives here. People and
 * traffic are made where the camera is about to look and taken away where it
 * no longer does, within a fixed budget, at the density the place and the hour
 * call for (GTA's `popcycle`: per kind of zone and per hour, so many people
 * and so many cars).
 *
 * - NOTHING APPEARS OR VANISHES IN VIEW (the player's rule, 2026-10-05). Made
 *   outside the view, in a ring past its edge, and removed only past a wider
 *   ring (GTA IV: born out to ~105 m, culled 70-115 m and only off camera).
 *   Zoomed out past where people are drawn, the walkers are placed round the
 *   middle of the view where nobody can see them, so a zoom into the street
 *   finds it lived in. Only a map just opened is filled in view, as a game
 *   fills its world behind the loading screen.
 * - People walk the footways with the walking engine (`agents/walk.ts`):
 *   zebras, signals, cars, each other. They go from one place to another and
 *   go in when they get there.
 * - Cars join the lanes the same way and drive the traffic engine. Parked
 *   cars (GTA's car generators) stand in the bays of the whole map, the same
 *   car in the same bay every time: never simulated, so never made or taken
 *   away in sight; the renderer draws only those in view.
 * - Zoomed out past where a person can be seen, nobody is on foot at all.
 *
 * SET BY THE COMPOSITION ROOT (`enabled`) and fed by the renderer
 * (`SimWorld.focus`): with no focus (tests, harnesses) nothing is made.
 *
 * FED FROM THE ROAD ENDS AND THE LOTS (`source: 'edges'`, the game's way):
 * none of the above is made round the view.
 * - A map opened (a saved one, a file, a generated city) is lived in at once
 *   (the player, 2026-10-09: "sempre que abrir a cidade tem que já ter carros
 *   e pessoas", revoking "only at the road ends" for the opening): the
 *   panel's numbers (`SimWorld.trafficCount`, `pedestrianCount`) put on its
 *   lanes and footways in the first ticks (`open`), as a game fills its world
 *   behind the loading screen.
 * - From then on cars come in at the road ends (`vehicles/spawn.ts`
 *   stepDispatch) and out of the lots' bays (`agents/lotTraffic.ts`), and
 *   leave at a road end or into a lot; people come in on the footways at the
 *   road ends and out of the lots' gates, and leave at a road end or in at a
 *   gate (`edgePeople`, `keepWalking`) - never anywhere else, so a town with
 *   no road end keeps its numbers on its lots alone.
