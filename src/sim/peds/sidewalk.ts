 *   (`vehicles/kerbStops.ts`).
 *
 * People walk on `world/walkways.ts` (`sim/agents/walk.ts`). This graph was
 * also the footway-graph pedestrian engine's network - corner paths, walking
 * corridors, a link to every door, destinations, an occupancy index - which
 * went with that engine on 2026-10-08; nothing read any of it, and every road
 * edit rebuilt it (the door links alone were P17 in docs/PROBLEMAS.md).
