 * arc position, its route. None of that exists in the People engine that
 * replaces it (a navmesh, not edges), so the renderer reads this instead, and
 * whichever engine runs publishes one `PedView` per person at the end of its
 * tick. The object for an id is kept for as long as that person lives, so a
 * renderer may key per-person state on it.
