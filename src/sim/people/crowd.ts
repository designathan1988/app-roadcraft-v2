/**
 * THE CROWD ENGINE: pedestrians walked by Detour's crowd (Recast/Detour,
 * the navigation toolkit shipped in most game engines; recast-navigation,
 * MIT), on the walkable space of `crowdNav.ts`.
 *
 * MOVEMENT has one owner. Each person is a Detour crowd agent: Detour keeps
 * its path corridor on the navigation mesh, steers along it anticipating
 * turns, and picks each tick ONE velocity by sampling velocities against the
 * people around, the walls and obstacles, its desired direction, maximum
 * speed and acceleration; the position is that velocity integrated over the
 * fixed step and kept on the mesh. Nothing in this file moves a body.
 *
 * INTENT is all this file decides, in layers kept apart:
 *
 *  1. the DESTINATION (`goal`): where the person means to end up. Nothing
 *     below replaces it;
 *  2. the CORRIDOR: the way there, as Detour finds it, walked on the right
 *     of the footway (`laneTarget`);
 *  3. PLACES TO WAIT on the way, held until the way is open: before a zebra
 *     not yet let onto (`crossings/permission.ts`), and before a passage one
 *     person wide while people come through it the other way (`passage`) -
 *     one way at a time, as on a one-lane bridge;
 *  4. in a party, a place beside the leader.
 *
 * VISUAL ORIENTATION is not movement: the body turns towards the velocity
 * it actually moves at; standing, it keeps its facing (or faces the way it
 * waits to go). A turn never changes the velocity or the position.
 *
 * Selected with `?people=crowd`. Recast's WebAssembly must be loaded first
 * (`initCrowd`).
