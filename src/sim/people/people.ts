/**
 * THE PEOPLE ENGINE: pedestrians as agents on a walkable mesh.
 *
 * Each person has a place to go, a route to it (A* over the mesh, pulled
 * taut through its portals), and a body that walks it: it turns towards
 * where it is heading and steps FORWARD, at a person's pace, with at most a
 * slow sideways shuffle. It anticipates the people around it (time to
 * collision, Karamouzas, Skinner & Guy 2014) and eases round them early; it
 * never pushes anyone and is never pushed. A move that would leave the mesh,
 * step onto a zebra it has not been allowed onto or into somebody is not
 * made: the body stops. So a person can not be dragged backwards, slide
 * sideways, jump, stand in the road or inside a lamp post, whatever happens
 * around it â€” those are not rules checked afterwards, they are the only way
 * the body can move.
 *
 * `docs/design/agency-architecture.md` Â§3.
