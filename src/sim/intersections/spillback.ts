/**
 * Don't-block-the-box, measured from real occupancy.
 *
 * This function replaces the single worst defect in the V6 monolith. Its
 * version was:
 *
 *   storage = downstreamStop - entryDistance - vehicleLength * 0.5
 *   if (downstreamControlled && storage < 0) return unavailable
 *
 * With both setbacks collapsing to `0.38 * L` on a link between two junctions,
 * that reduces to `storage = 0.24 * L - length / 2`, which is negative whenever
 * `L < length / 0.48` — 20 units for a sedan, 32 for a truck. Every link
 * shorter than that was PERMANENTLY impassable: nobody entered, the queue never
 * drained, and cars sat on a green forever while the network deadlocked. The
 * geometry also created such links automatically, since splitting a segment
 * near an existing node produces short stubs.
 *
 * Two properties make the replacement safe.
 *
 * First, the quantity is measured free space, not a formula of setbacks. There
 * is no term that scales with `L` in a way that can go negative.
 *
 * Second, an EMPTY outbound lane always accepts a vehicle, unconditionally. A
 * vehicle can legitimately be part-way into a junction while its nose is on the
 * next link, so refusing entry to an empty lane is never physically justified —
 * and it is exactly the refusal that wedged the old engine. This single line is
 * what makes the deadlock-freedom argument hold for every geometry the editor
 * can produce, not just for links above some threshold.
