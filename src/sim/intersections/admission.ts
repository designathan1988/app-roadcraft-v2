/**
 * Grants or denies entry to every junction, once per tick.
 *
 * This is the one stage that is order sensitive, because grants consume a
 * shared resource, so it iterates a sorted id list and resolves ties with a
 * total order.
 *
 * The critical difference from the V6 monolith is what a denial IS. There,
 * `canVehicleEnter` was six serial booleans and the first `false` won outright,
 * with no way for a later condition to soften an earlier one and no state to
 * unwind afterwards. Here a denial simply appends an obstacle at the stop line.
 * The vehicle decelerates smoothly under IDM and, the moment the denial goes
 * away, accelerates again — there is nothing to reset.
 *
 * Two V6 rules are absent by design and their absence is tested:
 *
 *   - No "deny because the green is about to end". Late-green entry is handled
 *     by physics and by the all-red clearance, which exists precisely for it.
 *   - No 3.2-unit arbitration window. The head of each lane requests entry from
 *     `max(8, v * 3s)` back, so a vehicle rolling to a stop — or already
 *     stationary at the line — is always a contender.

 * It used to answer "is ANYBODY on this connector", which made the easiest
 * movement at the junction the most restricted one: a right turn was
 * serialised to ONE VEHICLE AT A TIME along its whole length, however long
 * that connector was and however far down it the leader had already gone.
 * Measured on a four-leg signalised cross, right turns were the most blocked
 * movement of the three - 136 stalls against 97 for both left and through -
 * which is the exact opposite of the order a real junction produces.
 *
 * What is actually required is that two vehicles never occupy the same space.
 * That is a HEADWAY question, and it is the same one car-following answers
 * everywhere else: a follower may enter once the vehicle ahead has travelled
 * far enough along the connector to leave room for it.
 *
 * A vehicle that has been ADMITTED but has not yet entered still holds the
 * movement outright. It was granted first and it is entitled to the space it
 * is about to use; letting a second vehicle in front of it is how a grant
