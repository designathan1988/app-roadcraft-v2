/**
 * Small closed loops of road: rings of streets, roundabouts drawn as polygons.
 *
 * "Don't block the box" keeps a junction clear, but it cannot stop a CYCLE of
 * links from filling: every car let onto a ring takes a place the cars
 * already circulating need, and once every link of the ring holds a car
 * waiting for the next one, none of them can move - gridlock, measured on a
 * one-way ring of eight streets with four arms at 0.4 vehicles a minute out
 * and the whole fleet frozen for over three minutes. A real roundabout avoids
 * it because entering traffic gives way to the ring AND the ring is never
 * allowed to fill: here an entry onto a small cycle is refused while the
 * cycle is already `METER_SHARE` full. Traffic that is already on the cycle
 * is never metered, so it can always get round to its exit.
