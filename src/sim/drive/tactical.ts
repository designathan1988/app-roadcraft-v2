/**
 * Drive v2, tactical layer: which LANE a trip is driven in.
 *
 * The legacy trip planner searched the lanelet graph from the lane a vehicle
 * happened to be in, over connectors only. Lane discipline makes each turn
 * legal from one lane, so a car in the wrong lane for its turn found no way
 * to it at all and was sent round the block, or into a U-turn - the audit's
 * P1-19. A driver does the opposite: they know the turn is coming and move
 * across in time.
 *
 * Here the search carries lane changes as edges of their own. From any link
 * lane the car may cross to a sibling lane of the same carriageway, at a cost
 * per lane crossed, and only where the lane leaves room to make the change.
 * The cheapest trip then says where the changes are, and the plan is split
 * at the first one:
 *
 *  - a change on the lane the car is in now is published as `changeTo`, for
 *    `laneChange.ts` to execute as a mandatory change, while `route` stays
 *    the trip the car can drive from where it is, should the change fail;
 *  - a change further on ends `route` at the lane where it is to be made.
 *    The route runs out there, the planner is asked again from that lane,
 *    and the change becomes that lane's `changeTo`.
 *
 * Only one change is taken per lane: two in a row are one move to a lane
 * further across, which the edge already prices by the lanes it crosses.
