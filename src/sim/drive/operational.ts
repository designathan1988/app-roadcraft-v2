/**
 * DRIVE v2, OPERATIONAL: how hard to press the pedals this tick.
 *
 * The legacy model took the Intelligent Driver Model's acceleration against
 * every obstacle. IDM brakes as if the gap were an emergency whenever it is
 * shorter than the one it wants, even while the car ahead is pulling away:
 * after a merge or a lane change put a car 2 m ahead doing 7.6 m/s, a
 * follower doing 5.4 m/s braked at 6 m/s² - measured, 1 110 of the 1 176
 * hard brakes in 90 s of the saved map. That is the lurch a player sees.
 *
 * Here each obstacle is met with the Adaptive Cruise Control model (Treiber &
 * Kesting): the Improved IDM, blended with the Constant-Acceleration
 * Heuristic, which asks what braking the situation really needs if the car
 * ahead keeps doing what it is doing. A closing gap is still braked for
 * firmly; one that is already opening is not. The acceleration then changes
 * no faster than a driver's foot moves (jerk limits), and the Gipps safe
 * speed remains the floor that no comfort rule can override: the car can
 * always stop short of whatever is ahead, braking at its emergency rate.
