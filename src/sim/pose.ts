 * Pose of a vehicle, interpolated between the last two simulation steps.

 *
 * THE POSITION. This used to return the current pose outright whenever the
 * vehicle had changed lanelet since the last snapshot, on the grounds that
 * there is nothing meaningful to interpolate between two different lanes. But
 * a lanelet change is not a discontinuity: entering a connector, leaving one,
 * or transferring to a sibling lane all leave the vehicle within a metre or
 * two of where it was. Refusing to interpolate meant that at every junction
 * entry, every junction exit and every lane change - the three moments the eye
 * is actually following - the car was drawn snapping to its new centreline.
 * It now interpolates from wherever it actually was, and only gives up if the
 * two poses are implausibly far apart, which means the topology was rebuilt
 * underneath it.
 *
 * THE HEADING. The angle was never interpolated at all: it was read from the
 * tangent at the current arc position, which only changes when the simulation
 * steps. Between two ticks it is constant, so a turning car rotated in
 * sixty-per-second increments rather than sweeping, and at 2x or 4x speed the
 * stepping is plainly visible. It is now interpolated the short way round,
 * which is the only way to interpolate an angle without a car occasionally
 * spinning the long way through 359 degrees.
